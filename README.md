# Emotion-detection
This model processes a tweet dataset by classifying sentiments into different categories using three different sentiment analysis models (DistilBERT, RoBERTa, BERTweet). It evaluates the models' accuracy, applies ensemble methods to improve predictions, and visualizes the results to understand how well the models align with the true sentiments.
